# Introduction

**charachorder.py** is a wrapper around [CharaChorder](https://www.charachorder.com)'s [Serial API](https://docs.charachorder.com/SerialAPI.html). It provides functions for all of the commands available in the Serial API. It is a convenient way to kick-start your Python application that works on CharaChorder devices!

- Lightweight wrapper with strict typing
- Built with subclassing and customised usage in mind
- Simple abstractions allow you to focus on logic-building
